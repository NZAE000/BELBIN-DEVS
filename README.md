Teamwork is essential in any organization. According to Meredith Belbin, there are nine roles that individuals may assume to varying degrees within a team. The Belbin Test is used to identify these personal roles and to help form balanced and diverse teams. To make better use of the test results, a Java-based simulator was developed using a framework. This tool allows users to create and evaluate different team scenarios by adjusting interaction parameters between roles. As a result, users can analyze team compatibility based on the specific tasks to be performed.
